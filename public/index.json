After experimenting with different options, I finally decided to use the Hugo static site generator for its simplicity and speed.\nChoosing the Right Theme One of the most critical aspects of setting up a blog is choosing the right theme. After much consideration, I settled on the PaperMod theme for Hugo. PaperMod is known for its clean design, excellent performance, and ease of customization, which makes it a great choice for anyone looking to create a modern, minimalistic blog.\nCustomizing the Theme While the default PaperMod theme was already quite good, I wanted to give my blog a unique touch. I heavily customized the colors, look, and feel of the theme to match my personal style and preferences. This involved tweaking the CSS and modifying some of the theme\u0026rsquo;s templates to achieve the desired appearance.\nTech Stack Overview Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief overview of the tech stack I used to build this blog site:\nHugo: Hugo is a powerful static site generator written in Go. It is incredibly fast and allows for flexible content management, making it ideal for creating a blog. PaperMod Theme: A versatile and customizable theme for Hugo, which provides a clean and modern look. Markdown: All the content is written in Markdown, which Hugo converts into static HTML pages. Netlify: For continuous deployment and hosting. Netlify makes it easy to deploy Hugo sites and provides a free tier with generous limits. GitHub: Version control and collaboration. I use GitHub to manage my blog\u0026rsquo;s source code and keep track of changes. VS Code: My preferred code editor for writing Markdown and customizing the theme. Setting Up the Blog Setting up the blog was straightforward:\nInstall Hugo: Follow the official installation guide to get Hugo up and running on your system. Create a New Site: Use the command hugo new site my-blog to create a new Hugo site. Add the PaperMod Theme: Clone the PaperMod theme into your themes directory and configure it by following the instructions in the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation. Customize the Theme: Modify the theme\u0026rsquo;s CSS and templates to match your desired look and feel. Write Content: Create new posts and pages using Markdown. Hugo will handle the conversion to HTML. Deploy: Push your site to GitHub and configure Netlify to automatically build and deploy your site whenever you make changes. Creating this blog site was a rewarding experience. Hugo and the PaperMod theme provided a solid foundation, while the customizations allowed me to make the site truly my own. The end result is a fast, lightweight, and aesthetically pleasing blog that I can easily update and maintain.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re considering starting your own blog, I highly recommend giving Hugo and PaperMod a try. With a bit of customization, you can create a site that perfectly fits your needs.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:62563/posts/how-i-made-this-blog/","summary":"So what tech stack this blog is using and how I set this up","title":"First Post: How I made this blog site"}]
